# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
There are a number of benefits when it comes to using `async/await` over `.then/.catch`. Some of those benefits are that code using `async/await` are written similarly to synchronous code because these keywords indicate that this function will be asynchronous and will suspend the code until the expected promise is fulfilled or rejected (The purpose of the keyword `await`). Because of this, we can write code in the order of which we'd want things to happen like in synchronous code. We no longer need to repetivitely write out a ton of callback functions and because of this we can easily avoid mistakes that are common when using `.then/.catch` such as forgetting to explicitly return a new promise-- this can interrupt your application as the chain will be broken.
